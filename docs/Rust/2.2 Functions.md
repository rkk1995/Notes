# Functions

* Statement - instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
* Expression - evaluate to a resulting value.

Statement:

```rust
let x = 5;
```

Expression:

```rust
5
```

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable.

```rust
let x = (let y = 6); //Error
```

Calling a function is an expression (`hello()`), calling a macro is an expression (`println!("Guess the number!")`), and the block used to create new scopes `{}` is an expression:

```rust
{
    let x = 5;
    x - 2
}
```

The above expression evaluates to `3`.

**Expressions do not include semi-colons.** If you add a semi-colon, it becomes a statement and will not return a value.
