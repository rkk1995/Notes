# Cargo

`cargo new <name>`: creates a new project with the specified name.

`cargo build` compiles into *target/debug*.

`cargo build --release` compiles with optimizations. Creates an executable in *target/release* instead of in *target/debug*. Optimizations make your code run faster but takes longer to compile.

`cargo update` updates versions in *Cargo.toml*.

`cargo check` quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn't produce an executable.

`cargo run` builds and runs.

`cargo doc -- open` builds documentation provided by all your dependencies locally.
