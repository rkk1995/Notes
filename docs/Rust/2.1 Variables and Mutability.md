# Variables and Mutability

`let` declares a variable. Variables are **immutable** unless declared `mut` mutable.

```rust
let x = 5;
let mut y = 6;

x = 7; //Compile Error
y = 7; //No error
```

`const` creates a constant that is **always immutable**. This must be set to a constant expression, not something that has to be determined at runtime.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

**Shadowing** is when you declare a new variable with the same name as a previous one. (The first is shadowed by the second variable.) You shadow by using let repeatedly:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;
    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
    }
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```terminal
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

**Shadowing** is different from marking a variable as mut. We get a compile-time error if we reassign to this variable without using let. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference is that because we're creating a new variable when we use `let`, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

However, the following gets a compile time error.

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```
